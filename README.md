Little gamedev experiment in Godot.
I wanted to make a fully working vertical slice of a tower defense game.

Current Features:

- Map
- Tower placement
- Enemy spawning
- Waves
- Enemy increase in numbers and strength
- Credits gained upon enemy death
- Win/Lose conditions
- Rules/Debug info



UPDATE!
- Added an interest system as per suggestion from @Banjoschmanjo from reddit

- Added upgrades to Attack Damage and Attack Speed for the towers

- Added attack radius visualization for selected tower.
