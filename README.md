Little gamedev experiment in Godot.
I wanted to make a fully working vertical slice of a tower defense game.

Current Features:

- Map
- Tower placement
- Enemy spawning
- Waves
- Enemy increase in numbers and strength
- Credits gained upon enemy death
- Win/Lose conditions
- Rules/Debug info

UPDATE!
- Added an interest system as per suggestion from @Banjoschmanjo from reddit (https://www.reddit.com/r/godot/comments/1nlgfnj/tower_defense_prototype_free_to_use/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

- Added upgrades to Attack Damage and Attack Speed for the towers

- Added attack radius visualization for selected tower.
